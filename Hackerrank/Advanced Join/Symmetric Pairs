/* Count over 2 paris with the same values as well as those pairs with Y larger than X */

-- Solution 1

SELECT f1.X, f1.Y FROM Functions f1
WHERE f1.X = f1.Y AND 
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Functions WHERE X = f1.X and Y = f1.Y) >1
UNION
SELECT f1.X, f1.Y FROM Functions AS f1, Functions AS f2
WHERE f1.X <> f1.Y and f1.X = f2.Y and f1.Y = f2.X and f1.X < f2.X
ORDER BY X;

-- Solution 2

SELECT f1.x, f1.y FROM Functions f1
INNER JOIN Functions f2 ON f1.x = f2.y and f1.y = f2.x
GROUP BY f1.y, f1.x
HAVING COUNT(f1.x) > 1 or f1.x < f1.y 
ORDER BY f1.x

/* HAVING is used because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.*/
